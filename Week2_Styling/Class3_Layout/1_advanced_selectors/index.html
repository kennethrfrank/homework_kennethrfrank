<div class = "big">
    <div id="notification">
      This has an <code class = "strong">id="notification"</code>, so it is styled in CSS with <code>#notification</code>. Check it out.

<div class = "big">
    <div class="message success">
        This is a div with a class of <code class = "strong">message</code>, so it can be styled in CSS with <code class = "strong">.message</code>.
    </div>

    <div class="message warning yellow">
        This is another div with a class of <code class = "strong">message</code>, so it gets styled too.
    </div>

    <div class="message alert red">
        A third element with a class of <code class = "strong">message</code>, for good measure. One CSS selector styles all of these.

<h3 class = "strong">IDs are singular, Classes are plural</h3>
<p>An ID is meant to be used only once in a given HTML document. A given element can have only one ID.</p>
<p>A class can be reused as many times as needed in a given HTML document. A given element can have multiple classes.</p>

<h3 class = "strong">Using Multiple Classes</h3>
<p>An element can be given multiple classes, separated by spaces, such as <code>class="message success"</code>.</p>
<div>
  This has <code>class="message error"</code>, meaning it has two classes: <code>message</code> and <code>error</code>. It will get styles from <code>.message</code> and <code>.error</code>. The styles for <code>.error</code> override the default styles, which we achieve by placing them after the styles for <code>.message</code>.
